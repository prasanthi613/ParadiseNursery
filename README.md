#Project Overview:
The Paradise Nursery project is an interactive web-based application that simulates an online shopping experience for buying houseplants. The app allows users to browse a variety of plants, add them to a shopping cart, and view their cart's contents, including the total cost. The app also provides functionality to adjust quantities of items in the cart and proceed to checkout.

Key Features:
Landing Page:

The landing page serves as the first interaction point for users. It introduces the "Paradise Nursery" brand with an eye-catching background image, a company description, and a Get Started button.
Upon clicking Get Started, users are directed to the Product Listing Page where they can explore the available plants.

Product Listing Page:

The product listing page displays a selection of houseplants. Each plant is shown with an image, name, price, and an Add to Cart button.
The plants are categorized into various plant types (e.g., succulents, tropical, indoor plants) to make browsing easier.
Users can click the Add to Cart button to add plants to their shopping cart. The cart's contents are dynamically updated in the header, showing the number of items and total price.

Shopping Cart Page:

On the shopping cart page, users can view a list of all items added to their cart, along with their quantities, unit prices, and the total cost of the order.
Users have the option to adjust the number of each item, either increasing or decreasing quantities, and see the cart update in real time.
There is also an option to remove items from the cart.
The total cost of the cart is dynamically calculated based on the selected quantities and individual item prices.

Navigation:

The app includes a simple header navigation for users to switch between the landing page, product listing page, and shopping cart page. The cart icon in the header shows the current total number of items in the cart, updating whenever items are added or removed.

Interactive Cart Updates:

The app tracks the contents of the shopping cart and allows users to interact with their cart in real time. This includes:
Adding items to the cart.
Increasing or decreasing item quantities.
Removing items completely.
Updating the cart icon with the correct total count of items.

Total Cost Calculation:

The app automatically calculates the total cost of the items in the cart, including any updates to quantities or item removal.

#Purpose of the Project:
The purpose of this project is to develop a simple, user-friendly e-commerce platform for houseplants. By building this app, you will gain experience in web development concepts like:

Frontend development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Dynamic content manipulation using JavaScript (e.g., updating the cart, calculating totals).
Navigation and page transitions to create a seamless user experience.
Event handling to manage user actions (like adding to cart, removing items, and updating quantities).
